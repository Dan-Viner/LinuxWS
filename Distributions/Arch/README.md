# Arch
a new Arch WS initialization notes and files.

## installation
follow instructions from arch linux wiki.

some notes:

* _wifi_: in the installation process use iw and iwd (check this [arch-wiki-page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Iwd)). afterwords you'll probably install networkManager in your machine, so use it instead. set wifi connection following these steps:

		nmcli r (verify that all are enabled)
		nmcli d wifi rescan
		nmcli d wifi list
		nmcli d wifi connect <NETWORK> password <PASSWORD>.
* _timedatectl_: verify your system is using the UTC and not the local time zone using:

		timedatectl status (system clock should be syncronized).
	if not, use 

		timedatectl set-ntp true

### pacman basic usage

### HiDPI monitors
to set the correct DPI for your monitors you just need to know its resolution and physical dimensions (in inchs). to check the native resolution typs:

	xdpyinfo | grep -B 2 resolution
and check the physical dimensions using:

	xrandr | grep -w connected
then you just need to devide the resolution by the dimensions to get the native DPI for your monitor.

change the DPI using the following command:

	xrandr --dpi <NEW_DPI>

Notes: you'll probably need to restrt gui for the changes to take effect.
	

### Packages
pacman packages

	sudo pacman -S vim htop meld anki git vlc base-devel

many packages are not available directly through pacman and should be installed semi-menualy from aur - Arch User Repository. It's best to search each package in the arch wiki or the official package site, to find the exact installaion process of this app.

some 

snapd:

	git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/snapd.git
	cd snapd/
	makepkg -si
git-gui lyx eclipse snapd timeshift

### Snap packages
	snap install sublime pycharm-community android-studio spotify
	
### Gnome
	sudo dnf install gnome-tweak-tool dconf-editor

#### Gnome-extensions
	"topIcons plus" "dash to panel" "system monitor"
  
### Virtual machine
	sudo dnf install @Virtualization virt-manager -y


### Hebrew support
	sudo dnf install culmus-* alef-fonts* google-noto-sans-hebrew-fonts
when opening a file- you'll have to choose the right encoding.
#### Sublime
add "show_encoding": true to the user settings, and then the encoding will appear at the bottom of the window, click on it to switch to a different encoding.
RTL is not supported as far as I saw
#### Gedit (Gnome)
first add the encodings to gedit preferences through dconf-editor: /org/gnome/gedit/preferences/encodings/candidate-encodings/
I used this value: ['UTF-8', 'ISO-8859-15', 'UTF-16', 'ISO-8859-8', 'windows-1255'].
open file through the gedit app, and before the actual opening- change the encoding in the bottom (windows-1255 should work fine).
Partial RTL support

### Timeshift
How to work with timeshift: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMiCcFy4oGM&t=447s
Note: according to this tutorial from 2019 timshift might not work so well on Fedora because SELinux is enabled. I tried it and it worked fine, so I don't know...
You can check SELinux's status with "sestatus". See some more explanation regarding SELinux in: https://howto.lintel.in/enable-disable-selinux-centos/


### multimedia codecs
	sudo dnf -y install gstreamer1-plugins-base gstreamer1-plugins-good gstreamer1-plugins-ugly gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free gstreamer1-plugins-bad-freeworld gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-extras
	
### Dnf plugin
	sudo dnf install 'dnf-command(leaves)'
now "dnf leaves" will show all the packages that are not required by any other package
