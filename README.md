Creation of a new Linux WS has many internal components, which are independent for the most parts, that are basically the building-blocks of the Operating-System, and any other specific combination of them would result in a different fanctionality and user-experiance.

The hurt of the operating system is the linux kernel, for which we don't have much choise beside the specific kernel-version, if we have a preference for some reason (we'll might want to choose between the LTS version or the lateset kernel version, but that's pretty much it, I think). 

But other than that, we have many decision points in the installation process that we might want to consider.
